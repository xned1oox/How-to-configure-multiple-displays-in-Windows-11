Do you want to hook up another display/monitor or just attach another screen to your computer? if so this would be the guide for you. In this tutorial, i will show you some basic configuration when trying to hook up another display device to your windows 11 machine.


<h1>Environments and Technologies Used</h1>
<h3>Windows 11 Operating system</h3>

<h1>Tools needed to Follow along</h1>
<h3>Machine running windows 10/11 OS</h3>
<h3>Display device/Monitor you want to connect with your machine</h3>
<h3>Display & Power Cables assoicated with the display device/monitor</h3>

<h1>Deployment and Integration Steps</h1>
Step 1.) Becoming familiar with your displays
- Ensure you have all necessary cables to complete this guide.
- If you look on the back of your monitor/display device, you should see one of possible "ports" for a display or HDMI cable.

In this picture, the port to the LEFT is called a displayport and to the RIGHT is called an HDMI port. Depending on which type of port you find on the back/bottom of your device will depend on what kind of cable you need. 
- If its a display port for example, you will need a displayport cable, and vice a versa for an HDMI port (you will need HDMI cable). make sure to have the proper cables for this guide before going further.
- Check your computer to see what type of ports it has for a display/HDMI cable and make sure the cable you buy can support both ends for the external display and your machine.
- If your devices have both, you can take your pick as to which one you wish to use.

- (FOR GAMERS/CAD/HIGH END APPLICATION USERS: YOU WANT TO USE DISPLAYPORTS/D.P.CABLE IF YOU WANT YOUR SECOND MONITOR TO HAVE HIGH FRAMERATE AND REFRESH RATE CAPABILITIES)

Step 2.) The Settings
- Turn on your windows machine/computer and have it on the home screen. Once at the home screen you will then want to click on the windows menu (or hit the windows key) and go to settings.
- Once in settings, go to either "Display" or go to "System" then to "Display". This will bring up the display settings on your computer. In this section, you can change settings such as your brightness, you can add a night light timer that dims the birhgtness after a certain time of day (based on your clock dat and time configuration in windows), display resolution etc.
- Go down until you see the "Multiple Displays" tab and click into that. This is where you can change settings based on how many displays/monitors you have plugged in to the same machine/computer.
