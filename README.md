# How-to-configure-multiple-displays-in-Windows-11
Do you want to hook up another display/monitor or just attach another screen to your computer? if so this would be the guide for you. In this tutorial, i will show you some basic configuration when trying to hook up another display device to your windows 11 machine.


<h1>Environments and Technologies Used</h1>
<h3>Windows 11 Operating system</h3>

<h1>Tools needed to Follow along</h1>
<h3>Machine running windows 10/11 OS</h3>
<h3>Display device/Monitor you want to connect with your machine</h3>
<h3>Display & Power Cables assoicated with the display device/monitor</h3>

<h1>Deployment and Integration Steps</h1>
<p>
Step 1.) Becoming familiar with your displays
- Ensure you have all necessary cables to complete this guide.
- If you look on the back of your monitor/display device, you should see one of possible "ports" for a display or HDMI cable.

In this picture, the port to the LEFT is called a displayport and to the RIGHT is called an HDMI port. Depending on which type of port you find on the back/bottom of your device will depend on what kind of cable you need. 
- If it's a display port for example, you will need a displayport cable, and vice a versa for an HDMI port (you will need HDMI cable). make sure to have the proper cables for this guide before going further.
- Check your computer to see what type of ports it has for a display/HDMI cable and make sure the cable you buy can support both ends for the external display and your machine.
- If your devices have both, you can take your pick as to which one you wish to use.

- (FOR GAMERS/CAD/HIGH END APPLICATION USERS: YOU WANT TO USE DISPLAYPORTS/D.P.CABLE IF YOU WANT YOUR SECOND MONITOR TO HAVE HIGH FRAMERATE AND REFRESH RATE CAPABILITIES)

Step 2.) The Settings
- Turn on your windows machine/computer and have it on the home screen. Once at the home screen you will then want to click on the windows menu (or hit the windows key) and go to settings.
- Once in settings, go to either "Display" or go to "System" then to "Display". This will bring up the display settings on your computer. In this section, you can change settings such as your brightness, you can add a night light timer that dims the birhgtness after a certain time of day (based on your clock dat and time configuration in windows), display resolution etc.
- Go down until you see the "Advanced Display" tab and click into that. This is where you can change settings based on how many displays/monitors you have plugged in to the same machine/computer.

Step 3.) Connecting your Machine to the Display Device
<p>
- Grab your cables that we talked about earlier, and plug one end into the back of your display, and the other end into your computer.

- Once one end is plugged into your machine, and the other into your display device/monitor, you should now see your computer show a second display option at the top of the "Advanced Display" settings tab.

*Troubleshoot*
- IF your computer doesn't recognize the display device and the monitor/display doesn't show anything after plugging in all the cables, check to make sure your display device is plugged in and has power. If your display device has power, a power light will be glowing from somewhere on the bottom or front of the display device/monitor.
- IF the device has power, but your machine still doesn't recognize the display device, try to restart your machine first with the cables still plugged in.
- IF after the restart it still doesn't show anything, check in the settings tab if a display is recognized by the machine.
   
Step 4.) Configuring your Display Settings
- Once your monitor is recognized by your machine, it should display your wallpaper and possibly the taskbar that also appears on your machine. Go back into the "Advanced Disply" settings.
- The first thing to understand is that your machine and the display device need to know where they are from each other. At first, an emblem like this will appear in the settings

This is a default setting called "Duplicate These Displays". This indicates that whatever you have on your machine's screen, will be duplicated onto your second display device. This is helpful when you want to see the same window/tab on two different screens (potentially one larger screen).

However, there is another screen setting that i find much more useful called "Extend These Displays".

When you select this screen setting, you get a "blank" or mostly empty wallpaper screen on your external display device, and all your current windows/tabs are on your machine's display. This allows you to have mutliple fullscreen tabs/windows open at the same time. This is extremely helpful in multitasking across mutliple websites or programs.

- The numbers on the screen icons correlate to what screen is the "Main" screen and which screen is the "duplicate" or "second" screen. For example, if you started an application or program, that application/program will open up on whatever screen is labeled as the "1" icon in that settings screen. Most of the time I recommend that you leave your machine's screen as the "1" and your other display device as the "2" but its totally up to you. You can switch them around and see what happens to get a better idea of how it works.

- The display "icons" indicate to your machine where your other display is, so if you have the "1" display in the middle and the "2" display to the left, you will have to will have to drag all of your other tabs/applications to the left of your machine screen in order to put them on your other display device. If you wish to change this, click and hold onto your "2" display icon and drag it to either the other side, or you can put it above/below your "1" monitor. (TIP: Unless you have a special monitor/display set up or a TV above your machine directly, i would advise only moving the "2" display to the left or right of your "1" diaply icon.)

- For those of you who wish to play games, watch HD videos on each screen, the "Choose a refresh rate" option allows you to increase/decrease the rate at which your screen refreshes the images/pixels per second. (TIP:The higher the number -> the faster your screen refreshes -> the higher the quality/speed your videos/games will display in)

Step 5.) Enjoy your mutliple screens!
